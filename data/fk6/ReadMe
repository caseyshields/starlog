Description:
    The FK6 is a suitable combination of the results of the HIPPARCOS
    (Cat. <I/239>) astrometry satellite with ground-based data, measured
    over more than two centuries.

    The FK6 gives other solutions than the classical `single-star mode'
    (SI mode), which take into account the fact that hidden astrometric
    binaries among `apparently single-stars' introduce sizable `cosmic
    errors' into the quasi-instantaneously measured HIPPARCOS proper
    motions and positions. The FK6 gives in addition to the SI mode the
    `long-term prediction (LTP) mode' and the `short-term prediction (STP)
    mode'. These LTP and STP modes are on average the most precise
    solutions for apparently single stars, depending on the epoch
    difference with respect to the HIPPARCOS epoch of about 1991.

    The FK6(I) results from the combination of FK5(I) (Cat. <I/149>) with
    Hipparcos results. Among its 878 stars, it contains 340 objects
    classified as `astrometrically excellent stars', most suited for
    high-precision astrometry. The typical mean error of an FK6(I) proper
    motion is 0.35 mas/year in the single-star mode (about two times
    better than Hipparcos), and 0.50 mas/year in the long-term prediction
    mode (about four times better than Hipparcos).

    The FK6(III) results from the combination of stars from FK5 extension
    (Cat. <I/175>) with Hipparcos. Among its 3272 stars, it contains 1928
    objects classified as `astrometrically excellent stars'. The typical
    mean error of an FK6(III) proper motion is 0.59 mas/year in the
    single-star mode, and 0.93 mas/year in the long-term prediction mode.

Note (9): Systematic differences between the FK5 system and ICRS/HIPPARCOS
    system (in the sense FK5-HIP), for the star under consideration at
    the epoch J1949.4 .

    The differences have to be subtracted from the FK5 data at epoch
    J1949.4 in order to obtain the FK5 quantities at epoch J1949.4 in the
    HIPPARCOS reference system. The systematic differences given include
    both the rotational and regional systematic differences between the
    FK5 system and the HIPPARCOS system. The mean errors of the systematic
    differences at epoch J1949.4 are given.

Note (10): Flag for the use of the star in determining the systematic
    differences between the FK5 system and the HIPPARCOS system in
    position and proper motion:

Note on H: HIP indicators for a suspected visual binary:
    s = Flag S in HIP Field H61.
    d = Flag D in HIP Field H52, based on photometry.
         This could be an indication of duplicity.
    t = HIP Flags S and D (t = s+d).

Note on U: HIP percentage of rejected data (HIP Field H29 (F1)).
    one digit only (less than 10%)
    A high percentage of rejected data may be caused by a duplicity of the
    object, but other reasons cannot be excluded.

Note on F: HIPPARCOS goodness-of-fit parameter (HIP Field H30, F2)
    -        F2 < 0
    0   0 <= F2 < 1
    1   1 <= F2 < 2
    2   2 <= F2 < 3
    3   3 <= F2 < 4
        etc.
    A large value of F2 (e.g. larger than 3) may be caused by a duplicity
    of the object, but other reasons cannot be excluded.

Note on K: Indications on binarity from the catalogue of speckle
    observations (Hartkopf et al., 1999AJ....118..509H).
    b = binary resolved by speckle (or other interferometric) observations
        (such objects are generally excluded from the FK6(III))
    u = possibly resolved
    n = object observed, but not resolved (i.e. not hint to binarity)

Note on C: Indicator for a star which has one (or more) visual
   component(s) with a separation {rho} of at least 60".
   Source of information:
    c = CCDM (Dommanget and Nys, 1994, Cat. <I/211>)
    t = TYCHO2 (Hoeg et al., 2000, Cat. <I/259>)
    w = WDS (Worley and Douglass, 1997 (Cat. <I/237>), and updated versions
        under the given URL)
    r = other sources
    Visual binaries with {rho}<60" are generally excluded from the FK6(III).

Note on G, B, S, A, M, L: Binarity from radial velocities.
    v = radial velocity is variable
    u = radial velocity may be variable
    2 = variable radial velocities for two stellar components
    b = (other) indications of binarity
    d = (other) indications of binarity are doubtful
  Remarks about the binarity flag:
    f = probably erroneous indication on binarity.
    c = radial velocity is probably constant.

Note on T: Indication of binarity from spectral classification:
    b = binary
    u = possibly a binary

Note on V: Indication of binarity from photometric variability
    a = eclipsing binary, Algol type
    b = eclipsing binary, beta Lyrae type
    e = eclipsing binary, type uncertain
    w = eclipsing binary, W Ursae Majoris type

Note on P: Indication for a variability of the radial velocity V_rad_
    due to stellar pulsation (which may be confused with a variability of
    V_rad_ due to spectroscopic binarity).
    c = Cepheid
    s = delta Scuti star
    b = beta Cephei star

Global notes:

Note (G1):
    The positions and proper motions are given at epoch and equinox J2000.0
    in the ICRS/HIPPARCOS system, for the single-star (SI) mode of the FK6.

Note (G3): This is either the HIPPARCOS parallax or a
           photometric/spectroscopic parallax

Note (G4): Source for parallax:
     H = HIPPARCOS Catalogue (ESA 1997, Cat. <I/239>)
     P = Newly determined photometric/spectroscopic parallax
     C = Not explicited

Note (G5): Variability of the brightness of the star:
     blank = star not variable
         1 = star variable at the level of < 0.06 mag
         2 = star variable at the level of   0.06 - 0.6 mag
         3 = star variable at the level of > 0.6 mag

Note (G6): Flag for the double-star nature of the object:
     Kbin = d_1_d_2_ = 10d_1_+d_2_

  First digit d1 is based on the proper-motion differences {Delta}{mu}:
    The method and the meaning of the corresponding test parameters F are
    explained in Wielen et al. (1999A&A...346..675W)
      1 = all values of F (F_FH, F_0H, F_0(GC)H, F_0F) are below 2.49
      2 = at least one value of F (F_FH, F_0H, F_0(GC)H, F_0F) is
           larger than 3.44
      3 = all other (intermediate) cases
  Second digit d2 is based in other indicators:
    if the data indicate various kinds of binarity, the
    `astrometrically most disturbing' effect is given, as:
      1 = single star indicated
      2 = the star is a member of a visual binary (gravitationally bound
          system), or the object is resolved by speckle interferometry
      3 = the object is suspected to be a visual binary (mainly due to
          HIPPARCOS)
      4 = the star has at least one optical companion with a separation
          of {rho}<60"
      5 = the star has at least one optical companion, but all companions
          have a separation of {rho} >= 60"
      6 = astrometric binary (mainly the non-standard solutions O, G, V, X
          of HIPPARCOS)
      7 = spectroscopic binary with a known orbit, or the star is an
          eclipsing binary
      8 = the radial velocity of the star is variable (indicating a
          spectroscopic binary), or the object shows a composite
          spectrum (indicating a double star)
      9 = the radial velocity of the star may be variable (possible
          indication for a spectroscopic binary), or the object may show
          a composite spectrum (possibly indicating a double star),
          or other weak indications of binarity,
          or the star has a (suspected) planetary companion.

Note (G7): Flag for the double-star nature of the object based on differences
    between various proper motions (Wielen et al., 1999A&A...346..675W):
       1 = single-star candidate
       2 = {Delta}{mu} binary
   blank = uncertain (between 1 and 2), or the binary nature which is
           indicated by other data does not allow to classify the object
           as a single-star candidate

Note (G8): Flag for 'astrometrically excellent stars':
       3 = astrometrically excellent star with rank *** (the very best)
       2 = astrometrically excellent star with rank **
       1 = astrometrically excellent star with rank *
   blank = star not classified as astrometrically excellent

Note (G11): These fields contain the test parameters F for various
    proper-motion differences {Delta}{mu}. The parameter F is defined by
    Eq.(23) of Wielen et al. (1999A&A...346..675W).
    It is essentially the ratio between the two-dimensional difference
    {Delta}{mu} and its mean error. Values of F>3.44 indicate {Delta}{mu}
    binaries. If all the F values are below 2.49, the star may be
    classified as a single-star candidate.

   FFH: F parameter based on the difference {Delta}{mu}_FH_={mu}_F_-{mu}_H_
        between the proper motions given by the FK5 and by HIPPARCOS.
   F0H: F parameter based on the difference {Delta}{mu}_0H_={mu}_0_-{mu}_H_
        between the proper motion {mu}_0_ (based on the stellar positions in
        the FK5 and in the HIPPARCOS Catalogue) and the proper motion mu_H_
        given by HIPPARCOS.
 F0GCH: F parameter based on the difference
        {Delta}{mu}_0(GC)H_={mu}_0(GC)_-{mu}_H_
        between the proper motion {mu}_0_ (based on the stellar positions
        in the GC (Boss et al., 1937, Cat. <I/113>) and in the HIPPARCOS
        Catalogue) and the proper motion {mu}_H_ given by HIPPARCOS.
   F0F: F parameter based on the difference {Delta}{mu}_0F_={mu}_0_-{mu}_F_
        between the proper motion {mu}_0_ (based on the stellar positions
        in the FK5 and in the HIPPARCOS Catalogue) and the proper motion
        {mu}_F_ given by the FK5.
